    detail: Participated in Adversarial Machine Learning Research with Dr. Robi Polikar and Rowan Univerisity Signal Processing and Pattern Recognition Laboratory (SPPRL). This work includes researching the current state of Adversarial Machine Leanring and learning in a non-stationary enviornment. The goal of this research is to create an algorithm capable of distinguishing between concept and abrupt drift in non-stationary data.
